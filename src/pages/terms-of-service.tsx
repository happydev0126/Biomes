          <span className="underline">Changes</span>. As the Service is likely
          to undergo many changes over time, we need the right to modify these
          Terms to match the changing functionalities of the Service. You
          therefore agree that Global Illumination may change these Terms at any
          time without prior notice other than posting updated Terms to Global
          Illumination’s website (<Link href="https://ill.inc/">ill.inc</Link>
          ). Global Illumination will endeavor to provide you with prior notice
          when there are any material changes, and Global Illumination may
          require that you subsequently take an affirmative action acknowledging
          agreement to the revised Terms before continuing to access the
          Service. You may read a current, effective copy of these Terms at any
          time at [

          ), and your use of the Service after such time will constitute your
          acceptance of the revised Terms. If any change to these Terms is not
          acceptable to you, then your sole remedy is to stop using the Service.
          Notwithstanding the preceding sentences of this Section 3.2, no
          revisions to these Terms will apply to any dispute between you and

          increase the value of Global Illumination from your use of the

          <span className="underline">General</span>. In the interest of
          resolving disputes between you and Global Illumination in the most

          that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms
          or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration.
          Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
          neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more
          limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited
          review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
          that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes
          all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your
          use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
          misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of
          whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.
          YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” OR BY OTHERWISE
          ACCESSING OR USING ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, YOU AND GLOBAL
          ILLUMINATION ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO

          of Section 12.1 above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive,
          preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to:
          (1)&nbsp;bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) pursue
          an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state or local
          agency if that action is available; (3) seek injunctive relief in aid
          of arbitration from a court of law; or (4) file suit in a court of law

        <li className="c6 li-bullet-2">
          <span className="underline">Arbitrator</span>. Any arbitration between
          you and Global Illumination will be governed by the Federal
          Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively,
          “<span className="bold underline">AAA Rules</span>
          ”) of the American Arbitration Association (“
          <span className="bold underline">AAA</span>
          ”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA.
          The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at{" "}
          <Link href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</Link>, by calling the AAA
          at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Global Illumination. The
          arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to
          the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding
          arbitration agreement.
        </li>
        <li className="c6 li-bullet-2">
          <span className="underline">Notice; Process</span>. A party who
          intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the
          dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“
          <span className="bold underline">Notice</span>
          ”) or, if an address is not available to such party, to the email
          address of such party as made available on or through the Service.
          Global Illumination’s address for Notice is:{" "}
          <Link href="mailto:contact@ill.inc">contact@ill.inc</Link>. &nbsp;The
          Notice must: (1)&nbsp;describe the nature and basis of the claim or
          dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“
          <span className="bold underline">Demand</span>
          ”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim
          directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within
          30 days after the Notice is received, you or Global Illumination may
          commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount
          of any settlement offer made by you or Global Illumination must not be
          disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final
          decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through
          arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last
          written settlement amount offered by Global Illumination prior to
          selection of an arbitrator, then Global Illumination will pay you the
          highest of the following: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if
          any; (b) the last written settlement amount offered by Global
          Illumination in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
          award; or (c) $15,000.
        </li>
        <li className="c6 li-bullet-1">
          <span className="underline">Fees</span>. If you commence arbitration
          in accordance with these Terms, Global Illumination will reimburse you
          for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than
          $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees
          will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take
          place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, NY, but if the
          claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration
          will be conducted: (1)&nbsp;solely on the basis of documents submitted
          to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephone
          hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA
          Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the
          arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
          sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose
          (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
          Procedure&nbsp;11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed
          by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Global
          Illumination for all monies previously disbursed by it that are
          otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of
          the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must
          issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential
          findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are
          based. Each party agrees that such written decision, and information
          exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the
          extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the
          award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the
          payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the
          proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of
          the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

          CLAIMS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION 12). Further, unless both
          you and Global Illumination agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
          consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise
          preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

          reject the change by sending Global Illumination written notice within
